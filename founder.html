He is a legal expert in business development, negotiations, contracts, and ethics and compliance. He is also a writer, musician, and entrepreneur, and he understands the creative passion as well as he understands sober business.

          <p class='bio'>
              Greg is a a Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP/US)  of the International Association of Privacy Professionals  (IAPP);  and a Higginbotham Fellow of the American Arbitration Association.
          </p>
          <p class='bio'>
              After earning his law degree at Fordham University, he practiced in New York for nine years in areas including contracts, regulatory compliance, product liability, personal injury, and privacy. In 2012, he joined the in-house legal team at an iconic U.S. based Fortune 100 company where he was responsible for product and trade compliance worldwide.
          </p>

              Greg then relocated to Atlanta, where he led the legal function for a $400 Million business unit of a  French multinational before founding Delaegis. His focus is always on creatively solving problems, not just on quoting “the law.”
